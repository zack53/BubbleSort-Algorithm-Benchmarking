# BubbleSort-Algorithm-Benchmarking
The program is used to show the efficiency of both the iterative and recursive verions of the Bubble Sort algorithm. The entry point of the program is in the file SortMain.java. The integer array in the SortMain.java file can be adjusted change the sizes of the data sets. I implemented a GUI to display the data calculated in the program, and once the JVM is warmed up manually, the final results will be displayed. Contact me at zack.scott9889@gmail.com if you have any questions regarding the program.
